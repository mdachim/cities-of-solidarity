"""HISTORICAL ONE-TIME SEED SCRIPT — not part of the live data pipeline.

This is what originally generated data/action_bank.xlsx: the 12 Comrat LAP
priority actions (hand-encoded below) and the simplified example actions
parsed from LAP_Example_Action_Bank.docx (a path from the original authoring
environment — this script will not run as-is here). Kept for reference only.

Since then, data/action_bank.xlsx is the hand-edited master. To update the
live site, edit that file directly and run build_action_bank.py — do NOT
re-run this script, it would overwrite your edits by regenerating the xlsx
from the hand-coded data below."""
