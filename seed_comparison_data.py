"""HISTORICAL ONE-TIME SEED SCRIPT — not part of the live data pipeline.

This is what originally generated data/city_comparison.xlsx from the
hand-coded REACH/IMPACT PCP figures below. Kept for reference only.

Since then, data/city_comparison.xlsx is the hand-edited master. To update
the live site, edit that file directly and run build_comparison_data.py —
do NOT re-run this script, it would overwrite your edits by regenerating
